A small announcement in preparation for my next blog post about testing:

I've forked [https://github.com/hypoport/MockInjector](https://github.com/hypoport/MockInjector)
into [https://github.com/joerg-pfruender/MockInjector](https://github.com/joerg-pfruender/MockInjector)
and released version 3.0!

No need to write any boilerplate code for mocking dependencies for your object under test!
